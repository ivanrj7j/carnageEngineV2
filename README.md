## About
Hello There, This is a game engine intendted to make game development easy for new python developers.
Carnage Engine is based on pygames and adds many features on top of it and makes many of its aspects like window 
window set up object oriented instead of classic procedural programming. This game engine is based on Entity system
inspired by Unity Game Engine

## New Update on the project
I have been doing the project in 3d until now, I found that very stressful for myself to manage, so I am downgrading the project to 2d

## Features to be added
1. Scene System (Work in progress)
2. Window System (Work in progress)
3. Cordinate System (Work in progress)
4. Camera System (Work in progress)
5. Physics System (Future Work)
6. Sound System (Future Work)
7. Light System (Future Work)
8. GUI Editor (Will Start Working on it when above systems are completed)

## How To Install
1. Download or fork the repository
2. Open Terminal in the fork or extracted download folder
3. Type ``pip install -r requirements.txt``

## Disclaimer
This is my second attempt doing this, I have tried doing this before but the project got so much complicated with many classes, but this time I am trying to make a entity based system to avoid this!
